# Project 14 - Communicating on the Web

## Requirements:

**Option One**

or this project, you will be adding something we’ve studied this week to your personal web page. This makes the code yours, and can be an example of your knowledge. There doesn’t necessarily have to be a purpose for what you choose to add; in some ways you simply want to show off your skills to a potential employer. Choose from:

- Leaflet
- Asynchronous functions
- Collect form information in json format
- Google Maps

Whatever you choose, be sure to have clear comments in your code so a reviewer can understand what you did, and also so you can go back a month or more later and be reminded of what your thought process was.
